# Operating System
### Introduction to Operating Systems
This series of blogs follow the book which called **Operating Systems: Three Easy Pieces** (available at http://www.ostep.org). 

The three easy pieces refer to the three major thematic elements the book is organized around: virtualization, concurrency, andpersistence. In discussing these concepts, we’ll end up discussing most of the important things an operating system does; hopefully, you’ll also have some fun along the way. Learning new things is fun, right? At least, it should be.

Throughout this book, we try to use real code (not pseudocode) where possible,soforvirtuallyallexamples,youshouldbeabletotypethemupyourselfand run them. Running real code on real systems is the best way to learn about operatingsystems, soweencourageyoutodosowhenyoucan.
