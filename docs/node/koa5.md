# Koa in Action 5: MongoDB and Koa
---
In this quora-like project, we will use **MongoDB Atalas** to manage database. You
can sign up in [www.mongodb.com](www.mongodb.com) and create a cluster for our project.

The guide of **MongoDB Atalas** is very friendly to new users so that you can follow the guide
to complete initialization.
