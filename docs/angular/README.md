# Start Angular
Angular, an application design framework and development platform for creaing efficient and sophisticated single-page apps. 

To create projects, generate application and library code, we can use the Angular CLI which may be the most easy method to manage the angular project.

To create a new workspace and inital starter app:
``` bash
ng new hello-angular
```

The Angular CLI includes a server, so that you can build and serve your app locally.
``` bash
cd hello-angular
ng serve --open
```

This command will launches the server ,rebuilds the app and automatically opens your browser to http://localhost:4200/.
